# Dormant Accounts Compliance Process

## Bank Compliance Actions
Once an account is classified as dormant, the bank follows several regulatory steps:
- Attempts to contact the dormant customer through **written, electronic, or verbal communication**.
- If no response is received within **three months**, the funds are transferred to a **dormant accounts ledger** internally.
- **Issuers of unclaimed cheques, bank drafts, or cashier orders** are notified.
- A **final notice** is sent to tenants of dormant **safe deposit boxes** before proceeding with further actions.

## Central Bank Involvement
- If an account remains **dormant for five years**, the bank must transfer the funds to the **Central Bank of the UAE** under the *Unclaimed Balances Account - Dormant Accounts*.
- Unclaimed **safe deposit box charges** are similarly processed through the Central Bank after **five years**.

## Customer Claim & Compliance Checks
- Customers can **reclaim their funds** by visiting their bank and providing necessary identity verification documents.
- Banks **monitor reactivated accounts** closely to **prevent money laundering or fraudulent activities**.
- The **Bank's Compliance Division** and external auditors oversee adherence to regulations.
- The **Central Bank acts as the final repository** for dormant funds and ensures regulatory compliance.
